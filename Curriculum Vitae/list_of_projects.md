# Projects Worked upon

Dear Recruiter, I am pleased to share the list of projects in mobile development that I have been part of, throughout my career.

## Capgemini Ltd

1. **[MyMarque](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.psa.mym.mycitroen)** (Stellantis, France)

	This is a global app of the client to assist their customers in interacting effectively with their cars (Brands: Citreon, Peugeot, Opel, DS). The app has numerous features such as indicating fuel/electric levels, trip planner and history, maintenance details and schedule, location of vehicle etc.
	
	I am the offshore mobile tech lead. My task involved a complete understanding of existing features and their flows involving technical grooming meetings with senior architects and stakeholders, deciding the course of architecture flow to be undertaken for refactoring, providing estimates for feature refactoring, leading a team of technical members in the refactoring of these features, development assistance, ensure agile processes are followed, optimal delivery of tasks, ensure code quality by reviewing, managing master codebase branch for final deliveries and CI/CD support.
	
	I was part of a major refactoring project, as we needed to re-implement all existing legacy features using the latest architecture, design patterns, improved test cases, performance enhancements, CI/CD support etc. With my work and guidance to reporting devs, the app performance increased by 20%, decreased the overall bug count, and helped in faster deliveries of features in ongoing sprints.
	
	This was an exhaustive project for me that helped me learn a great deal about processes, architecture, and development flows.

	
2. **[McDonalds](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mcdonalds.app.uk)** (UK)

	This is the global app of McDonalds to cater to their customers to place their food orders for delivery. This was a transfer of an existing mobile application from another vendor to us for development and maintenance purposes.
	
	I was involved with the UK variant of the app. I was responsible for understanding the current architecture and design pattern, implement new features while resolving issues of existing ones, assist various technical teams, implementing specific UK region features and flavors in the app and till deployment on Play Store.
	
	I understood more in depth about the various agile processes and learned a great deal in managing the codebase using Git.
	
3. **Agill** (Cargill, Brazil)

	This was an internal client app for its sales team, to create orders and view order history for its customers. This app used SAP Mobile SDK for first time in our organization for performing CRUD operations seamlessly with the backend SAP system.
	
	I was responsible for leading a team of developers, usage of the design pattern and architecture to be followed, understanding the requirements, providing estimates of feature development, guiding the team members on technical aspects, development of features, unit testing flows, and delivery of builds in each iteration.
	
	The app was delivered well on time and helped the client increase their business flow by quickly capturing their customer's orders and processing them on time.
	
4. **Wit Gele Kruis** (Belgium)

	This was an internal hospital app of client for their nurses to visit patients at their homes and keep track of medical records. This was a re-factoring project as it involved a completely new re-implementation of the existing app into the native Android format. It was also specific for tablets only.
	
	I was responsible for understanding the technical requirements and flow provided to us, provide estimations for each feature following Agile methodology, developing those features, and unit testing all the flows. 
	
	The app was delivered well before time. I learned a lot about performance improvement flows like multithreading, RxJava etc that did indeed speed up the new refactored app.
	
5. **mAssist** (Reliance Jio)

	This was an internal client app for its agents, to assist their customers in their account management, issues and orders. This greatly enhanced the launch process of the product (JIO services) in the Indian market for the client.
	
	I was deputed onsite for this. I was responsible to directly connect with stakeholders to understand new features that needed to be developed, interact with backend teams to understand the API formats to consume data in app, and to develop and unit test those features. Also responsible for creating technical documentation pertaining to the app.
	
6. **Jio Newspaper** (Reliance Jio)

	The app was a prototype designed for the customers of the client that enabled them to read newspapers of major publishers on mobile app by downloading those newspapers and displaying them in a readable format.
	
	I was part of the development team to create the app from scratch. I was responsible for understanding the requirements and implementing the display page of the list of newspapers.
	

## Infosys Ltd

 	This project involved redesigning a client website in desktop format using web technology and tools like Adobe CQ5 for content design and management. I was involved in re-developing existing web pages using adobe CQ5 and web technologies.

This App provided major services such as email, messaging, storing voicemails, internet calling, online contacts, groups, favorites, caller-id etc. This was my first mobile project and I was responsible for  the development and issues resolution support of the application.

## Personal

1. **[PetrolIn](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flutter.fuel.petrolin)** (Flutter)

	This is a personal project I did to showcase my skills in flutter. This is a fuel entry app where a user can enter his fuel entry every time he refuels his vehicle. This helps in keeping a record of all refueling events. This is a completely offline and lightweight app. Please feel free to try it and add reviews. I will keep updating the app with new features, thus growing my flutter skills.

2. **[Cusine Central](https://github.com/sush562/App/tree/master/Cuisine_Central)** (React Native)

	This is my private POC completely designed in React Native for skill demonstration. It uses Zomato API to fetch list of popular restaurants. User can view the details of these restaurants, their ratings, address, cost, timings, etc.
