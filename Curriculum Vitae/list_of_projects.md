# Projects Worked upon

Dear Recruiter, I am pleased to share the list of projects in mobile development that I have been part of, throughout my career.

## Capgemini Ltd

1. **[MyMarque](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.psa.mym.mycitroen)** (Android, Client: Stellantis, France)

	I was the offshore mobile tech lead for this project. This is a global app of the client to assist their customers in interacting effectively with their cars (Brands: Citreon, Peugeot, Opel, DS). The app has numerous features such as indicating fuel/electric levels, trip planner and history, maintenance details and schedule, location of vehicle etc.

	I was part of a major refactoring project, as we needed to re-implement all existing legacy features using the latest architecture, design patterns, improved test cases, performance enhancements, CI/CD support etc. With my work and guidance to reporting devs, the app performance increased by 20%, decreased the overall bug count, and helped in faster deliveries of features in ongoing sprints.
	
	This was an exhaustive project for me that helped me learn a great deal about processes, architecture, and development flows.

Responsibilities:
	* Complete understanding of existing features and their flows involving technical grooming meetings with senior architects and stakeholders
 	* Deciding the course of architecture flow to be undertaken for refactoring
  	* Providing estimates for feature refactoring
   	* Leading a team of technical members in the refactoring of these features and giving development assistance
    	* Ensure agile processes were followed among feature teams
     	* Optimal delivery of tasks and ensuring code quality by reviewing
      	* Managing master codebase branch for final deliveries and CI/CD support

This helps in keeping a record of all refueling events. This is a completely offline and lightweight app. Please feel free to try it and add reviews. I will keep updating the app with new features, thus growing my flutter skills.
